# Environmental-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-project
Environmental Data Analysis and Visualization Project
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing GHG emissions data from various global sources to identify trends, major contributors, and emissions forecasts. The study provides insights into how emissions have changed over time and the role different sectors and countries play in global carbon output.

🔍 Key Objectives
Analyze historical GHG emissions trends over time.
Identify the top 10 highest-emitting countries.
Forecast future emissions trends using regression analysis.
Develop interactive Power BI visualizations for stakeholder insights.
📊 Data Sources
Our World in Data – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset
World Bank Climate Data
NASA Climate Reports
IPCC Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory
🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) – Data cleaning, processing & visualization
Power BI – Interactive dashboards for emissions insights
Excel – Data structuring and formatting
📈 Analysis & Visualizations
Line Chart: GHG emissions trends (historical and forecasted).
Bar Chart: Top 10 highest-emitting countries.
Pie Chart: Breakdown of emissions by gas type (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O).
Regression Model: Predicting future emissions (2025-2050)

## 🚀 How to Run the Analysis
1. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run emissions_analysis.py to generate key visualizations.
Import emissions_data.csv into Power BI to explore insights.
📢 Key Takeaways
Global GHG emissions have increased significantly in recent decades.
A small number of countries contribute disproportionately to emissions.
Predictive modeling suggests continued emissions growth if no mitigation strategies are applied.
📌 Future Improvements
Incorporate sector-wise emissions breakdown for targeted analysis.
Expand forecasting models to include policy interventions.
